            <h3> About Moose </h3>

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">

                Moose is like 23 or something I think. He is pretty darn cool. He knows a lot about Pokemon and Overwatch. He also knows a lot about basketball and anime. 
                He works as a night auditor for a very fancy hotel near where he lives. He and I went to college together back in 2019 and 2020. Currently, he lives by himself with a few roommates. 
                I would say his favorite thing is probably One Piece. He absolutely loves it and talks about it a lot.

            <h3> Moose's Achievements </h3>

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            
                <p>- Was like top 500 as a support player in Overwatch 1. (He was pretty big guy in Overwatch)</p>
                <p>- Can make minute rice in 58 seconds, which sounds impossible, but I've seen it.</p>
                <p>- Beat Pokemon Dark Rising 1 and 2, which is really hard considering the level scaling.</p>
                <p>- Has watched One Piece like 4 times.....</p>
                <p>- Has made a lot of really good anime and video game edits that have many views. </p>
                <p>- Was able to do a kickflip in 2013. Maybe now too.</p>
